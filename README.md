Gesture-Image-Capture
=====================

Capturing image with a simple hand gesture using sixth sense technology. Compile a C++ Project which continuously captures the frame on running with webcam. In this I have used two different color strips for sensing command to capture the image. When 4 successive and consecutive frames detects red and blue color strip simultaneously then Image will be saved in the memory. For hardware, I have used Pandaboard ES and in Software, I have used OpenCV Image function library with C++ programming in code::blocks. I have extended this project by saving the image in Google Drive through Cloud Computing.
